	// Defs for Aklarka:
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_displayName = Aklarka^N
	#LOC_CH_Aklarka_description = Aklarka is a strange planet, completely covered in a thick layer of clouds, radars suggest that below these lie a planet-wide ocean, some anomalies could pinpoint to possible objects floating on said ocean. Aklarka falls into the Hycean planet category. Some strange radio signals seem to be emitted from the planet...

	// Defs for Beekos:
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_displayName = Beekos^N
	#LOC_CH_Beekos_description = Being the second innermost moon of Magnifica makes it a little bit more difficult to reach, its stretched out shape is most likely due to its rotation speed and collecting material from Magnificas rings.

	// Note: Dasar was giving me some problems, specifically about biomes. The defs here are placeholders, once the biomes are working they will be removed/modified.

	// Defs for Dasar:
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_displayName = Dasar^N
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_description = Dasar is the closet planet to Harmonia, so close that some pools of lava has formed, creating sharp edges and flat plains. The lack of craters shows an extremely young surface. It has orgininally been confused by a very dim brown dwarf due to emmiting a considerable amount of light.

	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_LavaLakes = Lava Lakes
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_HotShores = Hot Shores
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_BasaltPlateaus = Basalt Plateus
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_biomeDisplayName_CraterMountain = Crater Mountain
		
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded1 = There is quite a lot of perilous terrain all about us, excluding the glowing lakes of molten rock quite close by. You think this is as close as you should get to them.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded2 = Setting up in such a location is certainly a daring idea. Best to make sure no equipment rolls into the lava below!	
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded3 = The terrain is much more uneven here as it leads towards the basin. You hope the volcanic activity doesn't cause a huge fissure to open up and sawallow the craft.	
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded4 = Although the glimmering rocks around the craft are much more interesting than at higher altitudes, they're probably much too hot to be picked up beside a quick surface sample.	
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded5 = Thankfully, this region of the planet seems to be the safest. Let's hope it stays that way...
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded6 = Although these temperatures are as "cold" as they're going to get landed on this planet, its still swelteringly hot under this space suit!
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded7 = The ground is still quite stable here but some interesting formations and gradients are starting to appear.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfLanded8 = The occasional tremor shakes the craft. Thankfully, there's still some distance between you and the hypnotic oceans of lava if something were to break.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed1 = Umm... its a little bit hot here. We should probably skedaddle out of here ASAP.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_srfSplashed2 = Did we pack any radiators? Jeb, did you forget the radiators AGAIN?
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow1 = The gentle amber glow from the lava beneath you floods the capsule. It's a sight truly worth coming all this way for, but staring for too long makes your eyes start to water.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow2 = Watching the molten magma slowly twisting in the huge basins below you, it fills you with determination... and a little bit of concern as the heat hits the craft.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow3 = It's starting to get quite hot now. Let's hope our equipment can handle it!
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow4 = It's much easier to make out the bubbling details of the swirling lava amid the sooty landmasses now. Is that a good thing?
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow5 = Harsh cliffs and gradients appear to inhabit this part of the planet. Probably not the safest place to land.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow6 = In the distance, you notice a large boulder getting shook loose by the tectonic activity of the planet. It rolls closer to the lava lakes for a short while before getting stuck again in the temporary safety of the jagged terrain. You breathe a quick sigh of relief and return to the mission.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow7 = A thick layer of dusty ash and loose sediment appears to cover this part of the ground. The craft might be able to land here but it may be risky.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow8 = The terrain appears mostly flat, but the occasional cliff or mountain appears out of nowhere to disturb this theme.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow9 = Patches of smooth, brown basalt rock finally interrupt the jagged cliffs and layers of loose sediment. They're probably the best place to land.
	#LOC_CH_Dasar_ScienceDef_crewReport_inSpaceLow10 = From here, the terrain appears to be as calm as it's going to get. It's saddening that the safest place to land will likely avoid the beautiful view of the lava oceans.

	#LOC_CH_Magnifica_description = The sole gas giant in the Harmonia system, it was named Magnifica due to the discoverer being completely baffled by the grape candy in the sky.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	// Defs for Majesty:
	#LOC_CH_Majesty_displayName = Majesty^N
	#LOC_CH_Majesty_description = Majesty is the only moon of Aklarka. The nature of its parent planet makes Majesty a nice pit stop for whoever tries to go and return from Aklarkas surface. Majesty agglomerate some material in the rings, creating a gap. Jumping from the giant cliff looks very fun !

	// Defs for Sanctar
	#LOC_CH_Sanctar_displayName = Sanctar^N
	#LOC_CH_Sanctar_description = Sanctar is a very welcoming world, falling upon it is extremely luck as it is apart of a binary system. Its sister, Alia, has very similar properties. Those qualities made Sanctar the number one candidate for kerbal immigration after they lost their home due to unfortunate events.

	// Defs for Valheilheim
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_displayName = Valheilheim^N
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_description = Valheilheim is the desert planet of the Harmonia system. This planet has very small rings and a huge plain, most probably due to a *recent* cataclysmic event, such as a collision. This place would be great to shoot some movies !

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_biomeDisplayName_ApocalypseDesert = Apocalypse Desert

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_ApocalypseDesert1 = You lean down and take a sample of the sand. It's getting everywhere! Little crevices in the suit are filled with dust.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_ApocalypseDesert2 = After taking a sample from the surface, you cap the tube. Tightly. Else the sand gets absolutely everywhere. 
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_ApocalypseDesert3 = Taking a surface sample from Valheilheim is quite easy. In fact, you have to try quite hard to get rid of the sand from your spacesuit and ship.
 	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_ApocalypseDesert4 = Grabbing a handful of the sand reveals that it is actually a thin layer above dark rocks, mostly basaltic, some peridotite seems to be mixed in.


	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Dunes1 = You get on the ground and scoop up some dirt. Here, you get some rocks as well.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Dunes2 = This area seems to be a bit more rocky. You bend down and pop a few into a sample tube. The scientists back on Sanctar are gonna love this! 
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Dunes3 = The rocks here are a very nice shade of golden-brown. You stare at the surface, thinking how beautiful this planet is.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Lowlands1 = The ground here reminds you of Duna, but not so red. A tear flows as you drop down to get a sample.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Lowlands2 = The scientists back at Mission Control instruct you to be careful with these samples. Apparently this area may contain water!
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Lowlands3 = The soil here is very loose at the surface, but gets stiffer deeper down. We may need a sample drill for deeper core samples.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Midlands1 = The surface here is harder, requiring the sample drill to collect. The fine dust appears to be a very beautiful shade of golden-brown.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Midlands2 = After drilling through the surface, you collect samples. The scientists back home instruct you to get multiple samples from different depths.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Midlands3 = While waiting for the drill to make it's way through the surface, you think about Valheilheim. What happened here? Did life ever exist here? More science will tell.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Highlands1 = The surface seems to get harder the higher you go. The drill is really struggling here. The knowledge we get from this sand will be worth it though!
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Highlands2 = The drill is overheating. You set it aside to cool down, making sure to check for any sensitive hardware nearby.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Highlands3 = The powderizing bit is too much for your drill. You switch to a coring bit, which helps. The scientists back home will probably be happier anyway with a cylinder of Valheilheim.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Mountains1 = Getting samples from mountains is a good idea, because if the planet had water at one point, the mountain might have been underwater and then have been pushed up. The drill is really struggling though.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Mountains2 = The drill is overheating. What is this planet made out of, titanium? You sigh and watch as the drill cools down slowly, and then continue getting a sample.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Mountains3 = From the data we're getting from the suit's builtin soil analyser, we can see trace amounts of organics! We need more thorough scientific experimentation on this though.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_MountCeleste1 = The higher you go, the more snow there is, less and less rocks are gathered with each samples.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_MountCeleste2 = This ground seems old, the samples taken contain traces of ancient rocks as well as a lot of snow.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_MountCeleste3 = Snow, snow and more and more snow...

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Poles1 = The poles of planets usually have some ice, but here it's sand. Again. You bend down, scoop it up, and get it off your gloves.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Poles2 = Sand from the poles seems a bit different than the other samples. Maybe the poles used to have ice? We can't tell for sure until we send this back to Sanctar.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_surfaceSample_Poles3 = The scientists back home think that getting sand from all the biomes of Valheilheim is "easy". That's easy to say when you aren't the one having to actually collect it though.


	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_ApocalypseDesert1 = You clamber out of the ship and look around. Not much other than sand, rocks, and more sand. The sand gets in little crevices in your spacesuit, and jams up the joints. A better suit is probably needed for long-term exploration here
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_ApocalypseDesert2 = After getting out of the hatch, you look around. Seems to be just sand. Why did we choose to land in the desert again?
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_ApocalypseDesert3 = The sand gets *everywhere*! Any small holes are completely filled. The sand seems to be sentient as well, since it chooses to jam up the sensing probes first.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Dunes1 = Finally, there is something to look at other than sand. There appear to be small rocks dotted around. We should probably pick them up and take them home with us.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Dunes2 = This seems to be quite a nice place! It is not quite as sandy as the desert, and has a few rocks as well. The scientists back at mission control will love these rocks!
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Dunes3 = You get out of the hatch, and walk out on the dusty surface of Valheilheim. You stare out, pondering questions like "Am I alone here?", "Was there ever life here?"

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Lowlands1 = You hum "Life On Valheilheim" by David Kerman as you get out of the hatch. More science will tell if that song refers to life other than kerbals.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Lowlands2 = The surface is dusty at the top, but gets harder lower down. It makes for an interesting surface to walk on! The color of the sand has changed as well, becoming a bit lighter.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Lowlands3 = The surface is definitely lighter here. Maybe the intense light of Harmonia hasn't cooked it a lot, compared to the desert.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Midlands1 = The surface is quite hard here. You feel as though you are walking on a tiled floor. We should probably get a surface sample and analyse it.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Midlands2 = The atmosphere is a beautiful golden-brown. The surface is a beautiful golden-brown. Everything on this planet is golden-brown. This entire planet is beautiful.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Midlands3 = This is one of the best spots on this planet to get a photo session done. We can log this as "scientific activity" so we can use the fancy science camera we brought.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Highlands1 = The surface is really stiff and hard. This would be an excellent place to anchor some stuff that you don't want moving.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Highlands2 = The ground is really hard and unmoving rock. It's a great place to send a rover, which doesn't need to worry about sinking in the sand.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Highlands3 = We should have brought some ground anchors here. This place is excellent for gathering data long-term, as there isn't a lot of sand that can cover up any solar panels.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Mountains1 = Finding a flat spot to land wasn't wasy, but we did it. Mission Control says that this area might have been underwater at one point, so if any life did live on Valheilheim, this would be a good place to find it.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Mountains2 = The terrain here is a bit tough to navigate, however we can get a good view of the rest of Valheilheim. This area is also rich with telltale signs of organics!
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Mountains3 = Mountains are not easy to navigate, and this one is certainly no exception. The surface has a bunch of loose rocks, which can slip under your feet at any point.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_TheSummit1 = You did it, you are at the top. They said you'd never do it, but here you are.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_TheSummit2 = You have conquered your fears, your inner self feels more at peace.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_TheSummit3 = At the top of the mountain, you feel lightened, each step you take feel more and more lighter. You have are suddenly hungry for a strawberry pie.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Poles1 = The surface seems oddly slippery. Maybe there is frozen-something underneath, covered with a layer of sand? Further experimentation is required.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Poles2 = Look ma, I'm on the top of the world! Or bottom! We can't really tell without looking at our instruments.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_SrfLanded_Poles3 = This place looks the same as the rest of Valheilheim, but it doesn't behave the same. Something tells me that there is more to the poles than what can be observed.


	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_ApocalypseDesert1 = You hang onto the ship as the autopilot holds the attitude steady. The desert looms below, looking pretty formiddable. The sand might cause trouble if we go down there though.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_ApocalypseDesert2 = Hanging on to the hatch, you look at the desert stretching out for hundreds of kilometers below you. Orbital scans show that this desert covers around half the planet.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_ApocalypseDesert3 = You peer down at the surface below. Hanging out at this low altitude is probably not recommended, but you have a parachute equipped. The sand is everywhere.
 	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_ApocalypseDesert4 = Grabbing a handful of the sand reveals that it is actually a thin layer above dark rocks, mostly basaltic, some peridotite seems to be mixed in.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Dunes1 = The dunes seem to have less sand than the desert next to it. Looking out the hatch, we can see the rocks clearly. Probably not a good idea to land there.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Dunes2 = The sand gets blown up by the engines. You are glad that the faceplate on your helmet is scratch-resistant. The fine grit is damaging the rubber seals though.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Dunes3 = As you look down at the surface, you see rocks. And sand. Basically the desert, but not as much sand. This is probably not the best area to land, but it's better than the desert.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Lowlands1 = According to Mission Control, there are signs of water detected here. Looking down at the surface, you can see faint traces of river deltas in the rock. 
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Lowlands2 = You see faint river deltas in the rock below. THey are covered in sand, but are still visible. Millions of years of dust storms have taken care of spreading sand everywhere.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Lowlands3 = THe dust storms on Valheilheim have spread sand on everywhere on this planet. You look down and see sand, but not as much as the desert.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Midlands1 = According to our instruments, the surface you see is getting harder. We should probably get samples from different elevations, as this is sort of new.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Midlands2 = Looking down at the surface of Valhielheim, you realise just how beautiful this planet is. All the photos from telescopes back on Sanctar don't do this planet justice.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Midlands3 = The crew inside the ship want to do a photo session on the ground. The only high-resolution camera we have is the camera meant for photographing surface samples. We don't need to put this in the mission log.
																														                 																														
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Highlands1 = The crew inside say that the surface scanner reports the surface to be "extremely hard". Looking down, you notice a mild color change. We should land there to be sure.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Highlands2 = As you look down at the surface below, you gasp in awe. THe stunning terrain looks, well, other-worldly. The crew inside feel similar feelings of wonder.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Highlands3 = The golden-brown surface takes up most of your field of view. As you look down, you can't help but wonder if life ever lived here, if life other than kerbals ever experienced the beauty of Valheilheim.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Mountains1 = The terrain is more jagged here. You grip the handrail harder, watching the transition between the relatively flat ground to these massive peaks. 
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Mountains2 = As you look at the mountains looming up, you notice some sort of snow at the peaks. We should probably analyse that snow. Maybe Valheilheim once had snowstorms up there?
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Mountains3 = Hanging onto your ship with that terrain looming underneath is definitely not for the weak-hearted. You really hope that the crew inside can fly the ship vessel well.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_MountCeleste1 = That's not how you're supposed to do it ! That's cheating !
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_MountCeleste2 = This isn't how you conquer your fears...
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_MountCeleste3 = Mount Celeste doesn't recognize this attempt.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Poles1 = As you look down onto the poles, you notice something weird. They look, well, a bit off. We really need to get data from them. Could be traces of organics there.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Poles2 = Looking down at the poles, you notice the same slightly white substance that covers the mountain peaks. What is it? We should probably send a sample of this back to Sanctat to be analysed.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingLow_Poles3 = The poles appear to be covered with a strange whitish compound. From this angle, combined with the buffeting of the ship, you can't look at it too closely. We should get some samples from there.


	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh1 = As the air whips by your helmet, you look out at the planet below you. The atmosphere is tenous, but still buffets your vehicle.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh2 = The crew inside warns you to not do this. You do it anyway. Valheilheim lies below you, stunning you with its beauty. You wonder if it ever had any other life on it.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh3 = You tighten your restraining straps and head out. THe glow from the atmosphere momentarily blinds you, but you recover. Looking at the ship, it seems to be holding well.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh4 = Getting out here was needlessly dangerous. Coming to Valheilheim was needlessly dangerous. But it might be worth it if we can get some research done!
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh5 = Flying at this altitude allows you to get a lot of tests done on the atmosphere of Valheilheim. Hopefully Jeb hasn't done anything to the sample catchers...
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh6 = Poking your head out of the ship, you get whipped by the atmosphere. You tighten your grasp, as falling from this altitude won't be... fun
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh7 = So this is why the KSC mandated height acclimation exercises...
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh8 = You shudder as you think about falling from this height. Your ship shudders as it flies through the atmosphere. You think about getting back into the cozy comfort of the cockpit.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh9 = You did a lot of training to get to this point, but you probably should have done some more height acclimation training routines...
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_FlyingHigh10 = At this height, the atmosphere is starting to thin out. Still causes some buffeting as your craft flies fast over the golden-brown terrain.

	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow1 = From up here, you ponder the past of Valheilheim. The dusty planet looms below you.  
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow2 = Out here, you can appreciate the beauty of the dusty, brown planet below you. Its origins are still a mystery however.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow3 = You think that if the planet below you could speak, it would tell you all about its rich history.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow4 = Valheilheim reminds the crew a lot about Duna. The Kerbol system is long gone, but you still reminisce about the past.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow5 = The dusty, brown planet below you has a certain charm to it. You'd think it's almost... alive. You shake your head to clear it, and get back to science.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow6 = Kerbals have come a long way since the early days, but have never lost the fond love for science and exploration. The planet below us is certainly a great candidate.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow7 = Looking down, you can see a small dust storm. Well, by kerbal standards it's quite a big one, but looks small in front of the majestic beauty that is Valheilheim.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow8 = You think to explore. You think to do research. You think to go down there, and find out all about Valheilheim's history. Could it have had life? Could it still have organics? We will find out.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow9 = The delicate shade of golden-brown bloom near the planet tells you it has an atmosphere. A tenuous one, but still an atmosphere. You can probably bag it and send it back home for more research.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceLow10 = As you get out of the ship, you can see Valheilheim clearly, not blocked by any windows. As you gaze upon the feast for your eyes, you think about what this planet has to offer.


	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh1 = You are finally here. You did a lot of training for this. Your ship approaches Valheilheim. The golden-brown planet has a lot of secrets to uncover.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh2 = You lower your glare shield. Harmonia is certainly much stronger outside of the comfort of Sanctar's atmosphere.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh3 = You peer through your visor, and think that the planet you're approaching is magnificent. The gentle glow of the atmosphere is certainly worth the time it took to get here.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh4 = No photos could have prepared you for the true beauty of Valheilheim. The planet reminds you of Duna, but more... mature somehow.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh5 = There is research to be done on that wonderful planet.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh6 = The glow from the atmosphere stuns you. Nothing could have possible prepared you for the raw beauty of Valheilheim.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh7 = Trying to not float away from your ship, you stare at Valheilheim. THe golden-brown planet has a lot of secrets for us kerbals to uncover.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh8 = As you soar through the vast expanse of space, you look at Valheilheim. The planet feels... almost... alive
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh9 = Looking at the planet coming up silences the crew inside. They sit in silence, appreciating the views. You look at the planet yourself.
	#LOC_CH_Valheilheim_ScienceDef_EVAReport_InSpaceHigh10 = Outside of the cockpit, there are no windows. There is only the unfiltered beauty of Valheilheim.

	// Defs for Requiem
	#LOC_CH_Requiem_displayName = Requiem
	#LOC_CH_Requiem_description = Requiem is a very small body with a very inclined and eccentric orbit around Aklarka, this leads us to think that it is a former asteroid captured but the planet not long ago. Looks like a potato, probably is very tasty.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	// Defs for Adiv
	#LOC_CH_Adiv_displayName = Adiv
	#LOC_CH_Adiv_description = Adiv is the biggest natural satellite of Trom, it shares similar composition, suggesting that it could be the result of a past collision.

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	// Defs for Eugalp
	#LOC_CH_Eugalp_displayName = Eugalp
	#LOC_CH_Eugalp_description = Being the smallest satellite orbiting Trom and orbiting inside of its parent's rings suggest that Eugalp is the result of an agglomeration of material within the rings.
 
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	// Defs for Etnas
	#LOC_CH_Etnas_displayName = Etnas
	#LOC_CH_Etnas_description = Etnas is the smallest body orbiting Trom, its orbit, shape, size and composition suggests that it is a captured asteroid.
